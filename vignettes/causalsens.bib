	Abstract = {{In observational studies with exposures or treatments that vary over time, standard approaches for adjustment of confounding are biased when there exist time-dependent confounders that are also affected by previous treatment. This paper introduces marginal structural models, a new class of causal models that allow for improved adjustment of confounding in those situations. The parameters of a marginal structural model can be consistently estimated using a new class of estimators, the inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators.}},

This framework is illustrated by an examination of the role of conditional independence in several diverse areas of the field of statistics. Topics covered include sufficiency and ancillarity, parameter identification, causal inference, prediction sufficiency, data selection mechanisms, invariant statistical models and a subjectivist approach to model-building.}},
